# Linear Regression Bike Sharing Assignment
> This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same. 


## Table of Contents
* Bike-sharing systems have become integral components of urban transportation, providing a sustainable and convenient mode of travel. Efficient management of bike-sharing resources requires accurate predictions of demand, enabling service providers to optimize fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. In this assignment, we delve into the realm of predictive analytics, employing linear regression to forecast bike-sharing demand based on various contextual factors.
* IDE - VS Code with Jupyter extention
* Language - Python
* Packages Used - Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Sklearn
* Conclusions - We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.



## General Information
- Bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- Data understanding, preparation and EDA
    - Data quality checks, if any, are performed, and all data quality issues are addressed in the right way. Explanations for data quality - issues are clearly mentioned in comments.
    - Categorical variables are handled appropriately.
    -  Dummy variables are created properly wherever applicable.
    - New metrics are derived if applicable and are used for analysis and modelling.
- Model building and evaluation
    - Model parameters are tuned using correct principles and the approach is explained clearly. Both the technical and business aspects are  considered while building the model. 
    - Correct variable selection techniques are used. A reasonable number of different models are attempted and the best one is chosen based on key performance metrics.
    - Residual analysis is performed after model building and the assumptions are validated.
    - The results are on par with the best possible model on the dataset.

## Conclusions
- We were able to efficiently and accurately check if the data is clean and clean the data if required.
- We were able to Visualise the data to uncover patters and insights.
- 'yr', 'holiday', 'atemp', 'windspeed', 'September', 'winter', 'Mist',
       'Light Snow/Rain' These are affecting variables of the provided data
